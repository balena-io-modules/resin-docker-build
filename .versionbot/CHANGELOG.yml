      The interface is extended to provide information about image tags
      used in FROM instructions during the build.
      It should not add too much overhead to what is already done by the library,
      but will expose quite interesting details useful in build analysis.

      Before this change, the Builder class would try to detect a Dockerode

      object be used as options (causing the resulting docker build to fail).

      It may be useful for a cloud service to store all of the layers which
      did succeed when a build fails, and before this commit that was not
      possible without doing some log parsing.
      This commit adds a `layers` paramter to the buildFailure hook, which is
      all of the successful layers.
      Also added tests.
